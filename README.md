# TuringText: AI-Generated Text Detection

## Overview
TuringText is an advanced machine learning system designed to detect AI-generated text across multiple languages. The project aims to distinguish between human-written and machine-generated content with high accuracy, addressing the growing challenge of identifying synthetic text in an era of increasingly sophisticated language models.

## Why It Matters
With the rapid advancement of large language models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and LLaMA, the ability to generate human-like text has improved dramatically. This creates several challenges:

- Academic integrity concerns around AI-generated assignments
- Spread of automated misinformation and fake content
- Need for reliable detection tools for content moderators
- Maintaining trust in digital communications

## Impact
TuringText provides:
- A reliable tool for educators to verify student submissions
- Support for content platforms to moderate AI-generated content
- Research insights into distinguishing features of AI vs human text
- Open source contribution to AI detection research
